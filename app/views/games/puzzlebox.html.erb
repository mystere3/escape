<h1>Puzzlebox</h1>

The puzzle box can't be opened but there is no lock.<br>
On the top of the box is a picture of a key and five buttons.<br>
Four buttons each have a single letter printed on them as follows:
<h2>E  U  N  Q</h2>
Just below these buttons is an additional button labelled 'ENTER'<br><br>
Type the letters in the order you press them:<br>
